      <h2>Street Photography</h2>
      <p>When I get the chance to go somewhere new or maybe just the same old routine. And I see something I like, I like to document it.
        And the fastest way is to take a photo. The image may not be the perfect one, but give it some time and these memories are worth it.
      </p>
      <h2>Gaming</h2>
      <p>I used to game a lot on the PC, particularly in the FPS <i>First Person Shooter</i> genre. I had an OnLive subscription that I used to
        play F.E.A.R 3 with, but later on OnLive died so I bought games on Steam. Left 4 Dead 2 was my go-to and occasionally some Counter-Strike
        and Team Fortress 2. But later I started enjoying build your own world games such as 7 Days to Die, Minecraft, and Valheim. Due to academics,
        and little time to game, I have only been playing games like Tetris and Taiko no Tatsujin on the XBOX recently.
      </p>
      <h2>Streaming</h2>
      <p>In terms of spending the most time on, other than practicing to code. I always have something streaming. Whether it is YouTube for documentaries,
        tutorials, or television shows. There is always something on. When I can relax completely, I'll have Netflix on and sometimes other platforms such as
        Disney+. I usually don't get into dramas anymore, as they're predictable, so movies are usually more memorable. In the past, I watched
        <i>"The Walking Dead, Supernatural, Game of Thrones, The House of Dragon, Vikings, The Witcher and etc"</i>.
      </p>
      <h2>Coding</h2>
      <p>I used to think I code only because I am learning and I love to learn. But it is more than that, I have continued to code after graduation. If I don't
        code, I can't sleep. Though I did well in most of my courses, I watch tutorials online and read articles and learn more about best practices. There are always
        new ways to do the same thing, or the same thing better or worse. It is always fun to know, one has options.

        <h2>Analog & Digital Photography</h2>
        <p>I grew up in an era where consumers transitioned from film cameras to digital cameras. So, I have always 
        been curious about what things used to be like. I find the analog portion kind of nostalgic. As film tends to 
        behave in a way that is hard to control. I have taken 35mm film photos and developed them myself and scanned them. 
        It is a long and expensive process but it is fun. But analog got too expensive, so I switched to digital cameras, 
        and started investing in the Micro 4/3rds System in Olympus. I love taking photos when I visit certain locations 
        once in a while. And the fun part is looking at the colours of the photos on the monitors.

        <h2>Technology (Hardware)</h2>
        <p>Advertisements always got me curious of new technologies, like the MP3 players, PC Hardware and etc. But never 
        got the chance to purchase any until college. Where I bought used parts from Craigslist and put together a PC. It 
        was the first time I put something together by myself with the help of YouTube videos. Other than computers, I was 
        into getting the latest cellphone every couple of years. I wouldn't get the top model but a mid-tier range where it 
        fits my budget. I follow YouTube Channels that showcase the latest electronics and technologies on my spare time.

        <h2>Chinese Professional Baseball League <i>CPBL</i> (Taiwan, R.O.C.)</h2>
        <p>Though I grew up in Vancouver, BC. I do have family in Taiwan that enjoy watching baseball. In fact, my mom's 
        cousin was a professional baseball player in the team <i>"China Times Eagles"</i> in the 1990s. My dad and one of my counsins are 
        the most influencial people to me that got me liking CPBL. It is not as a well known league internationally as Taiwan 
        is an debated isolated territory/country. But in the World Baseball Classic <i>"WBC"</i> and other international baseball games, 
        <i>"Chinese Taipei"</i>, the name Taiwan participate as, is ranked top 3 <i>(as of Jan 2023)</i> with Canada right behind. Taiwanese 
        players are currently playing leagues other than CPBL such as in the MLB, MiLB, NPB, KBO, ABL, and etc.
